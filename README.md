## Heya, I'm Gabor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Seattle, Washington with a background in Physics and Education and a decade of experience as a storyteller, condensing new and complex ideas into approachable forms. I get a kick out of extracting in-depth and at-a-glance insights from data of any kind, and I'm always eager to advance my learning to improve my impact.

I have experience in:
* Python
* R
* SQL
* Data Cleaning, Visualization, Reconstruction, and Communication
* Machine Learning
* Neural Networks
